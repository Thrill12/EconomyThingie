## Economy Game

This is a very early prototype for a fully player driven economy MMO in which players would have total control of all resources and components on the market.
The game's main focus would be on trading and gaining more and more money to overtake opposing factions, but would also offer players the opportunity of doing other activities,
like combat and exploration.

Again, this is a very early prototype nowhere near completion and will likely take me a long time to finish or improve upon as I am focusing on other projects right now.

The game is based on a server to which multiple clients can connect to it - there is an SQLite database under the hood of the game's database holding information about the 
game's universe, players, enemies, etc. 
There is an expansive universe already set out with around 10000 stars, which are connected with random lanes between them - all of this is stored in a pretty large SQL database.
